Keeping track of my malware development progress on GitHub! I'm currently focusing on process injection techniques.

# Disclaimer
I'm still learning, so please let me know if you see anything I need to fix or work on! I included compiled executables, but please make it a good habit of building your own... you never know what anyone could have placed in them if you ran them blindly.

# To-do
- Learning WinAPI
- Process Hollowing
- Reflective DLL injection (to avoid hitting disk)
- PE backdooring
