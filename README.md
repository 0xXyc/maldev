Keeping track of my malware development progress on GitHub! I'm currently focusing on process injection techniques.

# Disclaimer
I'm still learning, so please let me know if you see anything I need to fix or work on! I included compiled executables, but please make it a good habit of building your own... you never know what anyone could have placed in them if you ran them blindly.

# What have I covered so far?
- [CreateRemoteProcess() Injection](https://0xxyc.gitbook.io/hacking_methodology/malware-development/code-and-process-injection/createremoteprocess-injection) -- still working on writeup
- [DLL Injection](https://0xxyc.gitbook.io/hacking_methodology/malware-development/code-and-process-injection/dll-injection)
- [APC Queue Injection "Early Bird"](https://0xxyc.gitbook.io/hacking_methodology/malware-development/code-and-process-injection/apc-injection-early-bird-attack)

# To-do
- Learning WinAPI
- Process Hollowing
- Reflective DLL injection (to avoid hitting disk)
- PE backdooring
